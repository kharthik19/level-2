        <h1><u>html</u></h1>
        <p>HTML is a key fundamental building block when learning to develop websites. Students will initially learn the basics of HTML page structure and gradually transition into working with spacing, text formatting, lists, images, videos, links, anchors, tables, forms and much more. We also include several projects, where students are shown first-hand, how to develop and code html web pages from scratch</p>
        <h1><u>css</u></h1>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. ... The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</p>
        <h1><u>bootstrap</u></h1>
        <p>Students are taught to use the Bootstrap framework for responsive, mobile-first - front-end development. As one of the leading open-source development libraries, Bootstrap is an essential part of the developers coding arsenal. The section begins with teaching students how to include essential Bootstrap files into web pages. It then explores the Bootstrap Grid system and popular layout strategies for optimal cross-device and cross-browser compatibility.</p>
        <h1><u>javascript</u></h1>
        <p>In Section two, students learn to integrate JavaScript components into their web pages for dynamic client-side functionality. We start by exploring basic concepts such as JavaScript placement and Output. From there we move into Variables, Arithmetic Operators, Objects, and Data Types. Students also explore intermediate concepts such as math functions, arrays, conditional statements, loops, events, and functions.</p>
